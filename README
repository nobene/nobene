Features.
  Nobene is a kanban board.

  On startup it loads "help" board with usage information.

  You can create new board with +BoardName typed in command input field.
  Instead of [ENTER] click on <== button.

  You can load another board with >BoardName.

  You can save current board with >> typed in command field and then by clicking <==
   or by clicking â†§ button on screen.

  You can add new card to the current board with +1 ( to 1st column ), +2 ( to 2nd column ) and so on...

  By doubleclicks on card you can switch between 3 views : gray, yellow and hidden.
  Card will be then shown with chosen view.

  You can edit card just by clicking on it and typing/deleting new text from it
  and then by moving pointer out of the card.

  You can delete card by typing in it ????? and then moving pointer out of the card.

  You can open list of all saved boards by clicking on === button.

  You can close list of boards by clicking on X in the top right corner of the list.

  You can clone card with +++++ typed inside of card and then you will see in command field
  ready command like "++CardId", click on <== and card will be cloned at the bottom of column 3.
  You can copy CardId form [OUT] textarea field at the bototm left part of the app as well, if you
  get which card you wish to clone, paste it to command field preceded with ++ , then click <== .
  CardId can be copied from another board, then load new target board and proceed as above to clone
  card from 1st board to target board.

  You can delete current board with /delete .

  You can quit app with quit or q.

  You can adjust font size of cards with inputs =1 =2 =3 =4 in input field.

  Nobene app has Vebview.JS's context menu with handy copy and paste items.

  And of course you can drag and drop cards to new position on board.

  Every time you save board, two copies saved : BoardName and BoardName-bup.
  *-bup boards are not shown in the list, but you can load them with >BoardName-bup .
  If you save BoardName-bup, it creates BoardName-bup-bup :)
  So, you can load backup of backup and work on it too.

Backups.
 For backing up your works just copy entire directory "store" with all of it's content
 somewhere outside of "nobene" directory tree.
 "store0" directory exists for having "help" board only starting pack,
 just in case you some day might discard  all your prior work and start over again from scratch.
 In such case delete all content inside "store" and copy all from "store0" to "store".
